# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a place to highlight important points about web development as I take the coding bootcamp. It will help solidify what I learn and be a quick guide to go back to when I need to remember something. The most important part to this project is not only does this provide me with a resource going forward, it helped me to learn along the way by building it from scratch.

Below are two links, the first is to the main page where you can find my notes. The second links is a collection of all the resources that have been linked from our bootcamp, our SSM (Student Success Manager) and other students in the class.
