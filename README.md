# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a place to highlight important points about web development as I take the coding bootcamp. It will help solidify what I learn and be a quick guide to go back to when I need to remember something. The most important part to this project is not only does this provide me with a resource going forward, it helped me to learn along the way by building it from scratchc.
