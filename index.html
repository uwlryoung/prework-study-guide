              <ul>
                <li>static: HTML elements are positioned this way by default, not affected by top, bottom, left or right properties. 
                  They are positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</li>
                <li>relative: HTML elements are positioned relative to its normal position. This means you can set the top, right, bottom and left properties. 
                  Be careful: otehr content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</li>
                <li>fixed: the HTML elements are fixed in one spot on the screen (as your scroll down, it will stay with you in that same spot). 
                  Use top, right, bottom and left properties to move it. A fixed element does not leave a gap and so it will overlap other items. </li>
                <li>absolute: HTML elements are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. 
                  If there are no ancestors, is uses the document body and moves along with the page while scrolling. It can overlap elements.</li>
                <li>sticky: HTML elements are positioned basd on the user's scroll position. This toggles between relative and fixed positions. it is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the screen - then it sticks into place like fixed.</li>

              <li>Strict Equality: === : Tests if two values arer equal and of the same data time and returns a true/false Boolean</li>
              <li>Not, Does-not-equal: !, !== : Returns the logically opposite. When used with the == it tests whether they are equal or not and provides a Boolean</li>
